# Facebook Ads Digital Advertising 2020 Summmit

> This is the website of the Facebook Ads Digital Advertising Summit 2020. This project consists of one Landing Page, an About Us Page, and Tickets Shop Page. I developed all of them on my own using pure HTML and CSS with no frameworks. The site is responsive to laptop and mobile resolutions. I added an small bit of JS to make an animation more vivid in the landing page.
